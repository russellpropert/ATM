# ATM Exercise
### Description
This exercise simulates an ATM machine. It demonstrates using state with React.
### Improvements I Made To The Project
The original project was only one screen that had two buttons for withdrawing and depositing. The amount field and the submission button was on that same screen. I made the following improvements.
- Separate welcome screen where the transaction type can be selected
- Balance inquiry option
- Confirmation screen at the end of the transaction. 
- Styling to make the screen look more like a real ATM.
